        <p class='memberDescription' onclick="goToLinked('https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-w-radford/')"> I served 5 years in the the Army as a Cryptologic Linguist stationed at Fort Campbell and am just concluding that chapter of my life as of this June. I've dabbled loosely in programming since I was really young with visual basic and then JavaScript, but I've only really strived to learn more and develop my skill set to a more professional level within the last year after deciding that my ambition and long term goal I want to strive for is to start my own game design studio, and I've mostly worked with Python since that shift.</p>

        <p class='memberDescription' onclick="goToLinked('https://www.linkedin.com/in/sowmya-billakanti/')">My name is Sowmya Billakanti, I am from India. I'm relatively new to the US, having come here just 7 months ago. I enjoy pencil sketching, outdoor summer games and visiting new places like Paris, Rome, Hawaii, Santorini and many more in my list. While I wouldn't say I love cooking, I do enjoy it to an extent. I am looking forward to finishing the Bootcamp and landing a good role at a Tech company.</p>

        <p class='memberDescription' onclick="goToLinked('https://www.linkedin.com/in/dora-b-d/')">As an adventure enthusiast and aspiring web developer I am excited about collaborating and building the Dayyam Labyrinth, mind-teasing-maze with a bit of thrill. I enjoy supporting grade school stem curriculum by day and stirring up classic cocktails by night. I frequently engage in napping, gardening, basking in the sun, hiking, parenting, political activism, volunteer work, skateboarding, and snowboardingâ€¦ I have had to put long-time passions aside momentarily as I am currently engaged in a bootcamp that is kicking my behind! It has been an incredibly joyous venture and I am optimistic about endeavoring a software development career where I can better serve my family and community.</p>

        <p class='memberDescription' onclick="goToLinked('https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandria-creek-315079115/')">My name is Alexandria Creek and i am originally from Chatsworth, GA. I came to Seattle to live with my aunt and uncle and take this course. I have always really liked the idea of video games and graphic design. I like to draw and mess with photoshop to create fun/scary pictures. I am really into horror themed things and have a knack for creating horror themed cosplay, art, and design.</p>

        <p class='memberDescription' onclick="goToLinked('https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-ostlund/')">I was born and raised in Olympia, WA, I lived in Bellingham for 3 years as well, and now I have been living in Seattle for the last 3 years. I enjoy basketball and football, snowboarding in the winter, and wakeboarding in the summer. In my free time I try to read as much as I can while mixing in some movies here and there. Throughout my 20s I worked a lot of odd jobs: a butcher at Safeway, werehouse worker, Server/Bartender, and finally a Relationshp Banker at Chase before starting Code Fellows. My first job was working at Wendy's when I was 17. What I am really excited for is being to able to pay my way through my last two years of Washington State University after finishing Code Fellows.</p>
