    <h2>Robert Radford</h2>
    <p> I served 5 years in the the Army as a Cryptologic Linguist stationed at Fort Campbell, and am just concluding that chapter of my life as of this June. I've dabbled loosely in programming since I was really young with visual basic and then JavaScript, but I've only really strived to learn more and develop my skill set to a more professional level within the last year after deciding that my ambition and long term goal I want to strive for is to start my own game design studio, and I've mostly worked with Python since that shift.</p>
